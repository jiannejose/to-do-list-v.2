# (Very Very) Simple To-Do List 
### A Vanilla JS Practice

This is the version 2.0. I'm kinda proud of it because if you're going to check the version 1.0 (which I advice you not to 'cause it might trigger headache), this is way better and cleaner. 

Check To-Do List Githug page [here](https://jiannejose.github.io/to-do-list-v.2/).

Within the process, I've learned how to use querySelector, much better way of rebinding functions, and some ES6 syntax. 

I'm just starting to immerse myself to JavaScript. And yea, JS is not easy for beginners like me but I'm enjoying exploring it. Next step for me is to learn Classes and Object-Oriented Programming in JS. Then, React JS. ^___^
